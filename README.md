# ScrumTime

ScrumTime will provide an end-to-end agile project management tool that has a goal of being simple to use, simple
to change, and simple to integrate with other systems.  With this in mind, I have decided to go with a node.js backend 
and angularjs front end that will be deployed via the "public" folder of the node.js Express web application.  However,
the angularjs portion is developed separately from the express portion.

## Update - Nov 2014
My wife had the baby...

Now, there is a lot todo.  I am getting rid of the dependency on yeoman and I plan to adhere the project structure guidelines outlined by Google for enterprise level applications.
