# ScrumTime

The vision of ScrumTime is to provide a simple Agile project management tool to the open source community.

There have been several different implementations of this web application but none were completed to a full production level status.  The 1.0 version is intended to provide the initial production level implementation.  

**The most important goal of Scrumtime 1.0 is to provide a complete separation between the REST API and the Single Page Application UI.**

### Todo ###
- Get the ScrumTime.Foundation working before renaming to ScrumTime.Core
    - Migrate to ASP.NET MVC Web API 6
    - Ensure that the db can be switched to SQLServer (do not force MongoDB to be used)
- Consult OWASP to determine the best secure JSON approach
- Create a new UI that is a Single Page Application
- Evaluate GitHub and BitBucket user authentication mechanisms to determine if both can be supported
- Remove the concept of ScrumTasks (allow tasks to be updated on end-user's schedule...not just during Scrum meetings)
- Standup public service in cloud hosted environment (depending on cost)

### 1.0 Minimum Features
_**API supporting:**_
- **User** - A user is the ScrumTime secured user that belongs to the default organization. This provides the CRUD operations for the user.
- **Authority** - An authority defines the ScrumTime authorization of the user.
- **Backlog** - The organization of stories in priority order of completion.  This provides the CRUD operations for the backlog list.
- **Product** - A product may have stories, tasks, bugs, sprints, releases, or artifacts.

- **Task** - A task belongs to a story and/or a bug and may have artifacts.
- **Sprint** - A sprint belongs to a product and may have stories and artifacts.
- **Release** - A release belongs to a product and may have sprints and artifacts.
- **Artifact** - An artifact belongs to a product, teamMember, team, story, task, sprint, bug, or release.  This is an uploadable file.
- **Bug** - A bug belongs to a product, story, or bug and may have tasks and artifacts.

_**Single-Page-Application:**_
- Separate the UI project completely from the REST API
