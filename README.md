# ScrumTime

ScrumTime will provide an end-to-end agile project management tool that has a goal of being simple to use, simple
to change, and simple to integrate with other systems.  With this in mind, I have decided to go with a node.js backend 
and angularjs front end that will be deployed via the "public" folder of the node.js Express web application.  However,
the angularjs portion is developed separately from the express portion.
