# ScrumTime

The vision of ScrumTime is to provide a simple Agile project management tool to the open source community.

There have been several different implementations of this web application but none were completed to a full production level status.  The 1.0 version is intended to provide the initial production level implementation.  

**The most important goal of Scrumtime 1.0 is to provide a complete separation between the REST API and the Single Page Application UI.**

### 1.0 Minimum Features
_**Microservices API supporting:**_
-User - A user is the ScrumTime secured user that belongs to the default organization. This provides the CRUD operations for the user.
-Authority - An authority defines the ScrumTime authorization of the user.
-Backlog - The organization of stories in priority order of completion.  This provides the CRUD operations for the backlog list.
-Product - A product may have stories, tasks, bugs, sprints, releases, or artifacts.
-Team - A team belongs to the default organization and has team members and artifacts.
-TeamMember - A teamMember belongs to a team and may have artifacts.
-Story - A story belongs to a product, may contain artifacts, and may have child tasks or bugs.
-Task - A task belongs to a story and/or a bug and may have artifacts.
-Sprint - A sprint belongs to a product and may have stories and artifacts.
-Release - A release belongs to a product and may have sprints and artifacts.
-Artifact - An artifact belongs to a product, teamMember, team, story, task, sprint, bug, or release.  This is an uploadable file.
-Bug - A bug belongs to a product, story, or bug and may have tasks and artifacts.

_**Single-Page-Application:**_
-Separate the UI project completely from the rest-api

### Post 1.0 Features
_**Microservices API supporting:**_ 
-HierarchicalEpic - Allows epics to be defined with parent/child relationships to other Epics.
-HierarchicalStory - Allows stories to be defined with parent/child relationships to other Stories.
-HierarchicalTask - Allows tasks to be defined with parent/child relationships to other Tasks.
-Actor - An actor belongs to a product and may be used by multiple stories and has artifacts.
-TeamRole - A team role belongs to a team member.
-TeamMember - A team member belongs to a team and has artifacts.
-Customer - A customer belongs to a product and default organization and has support tickets, ideas, feature requests, and invoices.
-SupportTicket - A support ticket belongs to a customer and a product and has bugs, stories, sprints, and releases.
-FeatureRequest - A feature request belongs to a customer and a product and has bugs, stories, sprints, releases, and artifacts.
-ParkingLot - A parking lot belongs to a product and has stories, feature requests, and ideas.
-Idea - An idea belongs to a parking lot and has artifacts.
-Impediment - An impediment belongs to a sprint and has teams, team members, tasks, stories, customers, support tickets, ideas, and artifacts.
-CustomerWiki - A customer wiki belongs to a product and has customer surveys, impediments, ideas, feature requests, support tickets, release notes, invoices, invoice alerts, release alerts, and artifacts.
-TeamWiki - A team wiki belongs to a team and/or default organization and has team members, teams, work assignment alerts, sprint notes, release notes, release alerts, impediments, and artifacts.
-Invoice - An invoice belongs to a customer and product.
-CustomerSurvey - A customer survey belongs to a customer wiki.
-ReleaseNote - A release note belongs to a release and has customer wikis and team wikis.
-SprintNote - A sprint note belongs to a sprint and has team wikis.
-InvoiceAlert - An invoice alert belongs to a customer and has customer wikis.
-ReleaseAlert - A release alert belongs to a release and has customer wikis and team wikis.
-WorkAssignmentAlert - A work assignment alert belongs to a product and has users.

_**Single-Page-Application:**_
-The SPA UI will likely break release cycle from the REST API at this point to accommodate a quick release cycle for the UI separate from the API.

###Languages
Javascript/CSS/HTML - UI stand alone project
Java/Groovy - Microservices implementation *(may switch to Spring Boot/Spring Data (going to do a spike to decide))*

###Data Store
As with releases of 0.4 through 0.6, the goal is to abstract the datastore technology as much as possible to elminiate being tied to a particular database.

It seems most likely that Spring Data will be used to expose data via REST endpoints.  The underlying datastore may be switched as long as it supports JPA.
