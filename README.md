# ScrumTime #

## All new development is being done on project AgilePlan

## [AgilePlan](https://github.com/erniep888/AgilePlan) ##


### Explanation ###

The vision of ScrumTime was to provide a simple Agile project management tool to the open source community.

There were several different implementations of this web application but none were completed to a full production level status.  [AgilePlan](https://github.com/erniep888/AgilePlan) is a continuation based on lessons learned over the past fifteen or so years.

The master branch reflects the miniscule updates made after release/0.9-Beta1.

Sincerely,
Ernie
