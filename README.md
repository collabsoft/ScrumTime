ScrumTime 1.0 Alpha (May 2014)
=============

Definition
------
ScrumTime is an agile Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) system that centralizes client billing, team management, project definition, client interaction, and project sustainment. This is an open source product that is highly scalable and extensible.

The UI is composed entirely of HTML, javascript, and CSS.  The primary javascript library that makes this possible is AngularJS.  The data is supplied via RESTful interface with JSON data format.

Future
------
I would like to find someone interested in doing an Android app, an iPhone app, and/or a Windows phone app.  These apps will be relatively simple because they will reuse the RESTful Server API.  It will not make sense to begin these efforts until the API is available.  I expect that to be June 2014.  Please email: epaschall@bytefirm.com if you are interested.
